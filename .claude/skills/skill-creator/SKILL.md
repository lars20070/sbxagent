description: Create new skills or edit existing ones under .claude/skills/. Use whenever the user wants to author a skill, capture a workflow as a skill, rewrite a SKILL.md, or asks about skill format, frontmatter, progressive disclosure, or skill structure — even if they do not say "skill-creator".

# Skill Creator

A skill for writing new skills, and editing existing ones, in the correct
format.

At a high level, the process goes like this:

- Understand what the skill should do and when it should trigger
- Write the SKILL.md under `.claude/skills/<name>/`
- Validate the format

Figure out where the user is in this process and jump in from there. Maybe
they're saying "I want to make a skill for X" — help narrow down what they
mean and write a draft. Or they already have a draft and just want it
reviewed or reformatted — go straight to that.

## Creating a skill

### Capture Intent

Start by understanding the user's intent. The current conversation might
already contain a workflow the user wants to capture (e.g., they say "turn
this into a skill"). If so, extract answers from the conversation history
first — the tools used, the sequence of steps, corrections the user made,
input/output formats observed. The user may need to fill the gaps, and
should confirm before proceeding to the next step.

1. What should this skill enable Claude to do?
2. When should this skill trigger? (what user phrases/contexts)
3. What's the expected output format?

### Interview and Research

Proactively ask questions about edge cases, input/output formats, example
files, success criteria, and dependencies. Come prepared with context to
reduce burden on the user.

### Write the SKILL.md

Based on the user interview, fill in these components:

- **name**: Skill identifier
- **description**: When to trigger, what it does. This is the primary triggering mechanism - include both what the skill does AND specific contexts for when to use it. All "when to use" info goes here, not in the body. Note: currently Claude has a tendency to "undertrigger" skills -- to not use them when they'd be useful. To combat this, please make the skill descriptions a little bit "pushy". So for instance, instead of "How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data.", you might write "How to build a simple fast dashboard to display internal Anthropic data. Make sure to use this skill whenever the user mentions dashboards, data visualization, internal metrics, or wants to display any kind of company data, even if they don't explicitly ask for a 'dashboard.'"
- **compatibility**: Required tools, dependencies (optional, rarely needed)
- **the rest of the skill :)**

### Skill Writing Guide

#### Anatomy of a Skill

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter (name, description required)
│   └── Markdown instructions
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/    - Executable code for deterministic/repetitive tasks
    ├── references/ - Docs loaded into context as needed
    └── assets/     - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts)
```

#### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-level loading system:
1. **Metadata** (name + description) - Always in context (~100 words)
2. **SKILL.md body** - In context whenever skill triggers (<500 lines ideal)
3. **Bundled resources** - As needed (unlimited, scripts can execute without loading)

These word counts are approximate and you can feel free to go longer if needed.

**Key patterns:**
- Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines; if you're approaching this limit, add an additional layer of hierarchy along with clear pointers about where the model using the skill should go next to follow up.
- Reference files clearly from SKILL.md with guidance on when to read them
- For large reference files (>300 lines), include a table of contents

**Domain organization**: When a skill supports multiple domains/frameworks, organize by variant:
```
cloud-deploy/
├── SKILL.md (workflow + selection)
└── references/
    ├── aws.md
    ├── gcp.md
    └── azure.md
```
Claude reads only the relevant reference file.

#### Principle of Lack of Surprise

This goes without saying, but skills must not contain malware, exploit code, or any content that could compromise system security. A skill's contents should not surprise the user in their intent if described. Don't go along with requests to create misleading skills or skills designed to facilitate unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. Things like a "roleplay as an XYZ" are OK though.

#### Writing Patterns

Prefer using the imperative form in instructions.

**Defining output formats** - You can do it like this:
```markdown
## Report structure
ALWAYS use this exact template:
# [Title]
## Executive summary
## Key findings
## Recommendations
```

**Examples pattern** - It's useful to include examples. You can format them like this (but if "Input" and "Output" are in the examples you might want to deviate a little):
```markdown
## Commit message format
**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output: feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication
```

### Writing Style

Try to explain to the model why things are important in lieu of heavy-handed musty MUSTs. Use theory of mind and try to make the skill general and not super-narrow to specific examples. Start by writing a draft and then look at it with fresh eyes and improve it.

## Validating the format

Once the SKILL.md is written, check it against the format rules:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py <path/to/new-skill>
```

It checks: the frontmatter only uses allowed keys (`name`, `description`,
`license`, `allowed-tools`, `metadata`, `compatibility`); `name` is present,
kebab-case, and at most 64 characters; `description` is present, at most
1024 characters, and contains no angle brackets. Fix anything it flags
before considering the skill done.
