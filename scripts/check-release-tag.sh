# workflow_dispatch GITHUB_REF_NAME is a branch, which would fail the shape
# check below, so a dispatch reads VERSION itself instead of calling this.
#
# This deliberately does NOT re-check kits/*/spec.yaml or CHANGELOG.md. `make
# lint` already fails when VERSION, any kit spec version, or CHANGELOG.md's
# latest release heading disagree, and the release workflow runs `make lint` in
# the same job. Duplicating that here would be a second copy to keep in sync.
